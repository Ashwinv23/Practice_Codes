        <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li><br>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header><h2>Variables</h2></header>
        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header><h2>Declaring variables</h2></header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways. With the keyword var. For example,
          <pre><code>var x = 42.</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables. By simply assigning it a value. For example,
          <pre><code>x = 42.</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant. With the keyword let. For example,
        <pre><code>let y = 13.</code></pre>
        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header><h2>Function declarations</h2></header>
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways. With the keyword var. For example,
          <pre><code>var x = 42.</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant. With the keyword let. For example,
        <pre><code>let y = 13.</code></pre>
        This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
        </p>
        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement)  consists of the function keyword, followed by
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li><br>
          <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li><br>
          <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
        <header><h2>Global variables</h2></header>
        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
        <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
